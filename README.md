Course overview

"In this course, part of the C Programming with Linux Professional Certificate program,  you will define your own data types in C, and use the newly created types to more efficiently store and process your data. 
Many programming languages provide a number of built-in data types to store things such as integers, decimals, and characters in variables, but what if you wanted to store more complex data? Defining your own data types in C allows you to more efficiently store and process data such as a customer's name, age and other relevant data, all in one single variable!"
